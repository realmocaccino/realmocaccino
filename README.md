# Luiz Gustavo
**`Senior PHP Developer / Laravel Certified`**

I'm a software engineer based in Rio. I've been building websites using PHP for over 14 years.

I'm the founder of [Nota do Game](https://notadogame.com) â€” a gaming review platform where people rate and share their thoughts on titles they played.

My expertise extends to Laravel, framework that [I'm officially certified](https://exam.laravelcert.com/is/luiz-gustavo-martins-da-silva/certified-since/2019-03-20).

I also developed [Jauntyslider](https://jauntyslider.luizgustavomartins.com/), a lightweight and dependency-free JavaScript package that turns any HTML list into a fully functional carousel.
